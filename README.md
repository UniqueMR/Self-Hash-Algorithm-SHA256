# self hash algorithm (SHA256)

This is a self-implemented hash algorithm based on the SHA256 standard. This project can achieve encrypting a message into a 256bits hash value.

## Usage

There are four test instances displayed in main.py. To try these test instances, you can run `python main.py`. You can compare the result of these instances with the standard results in https://www.di-mgt.com.au/sha_testvectors.html to check if the implementation functions properly. You can also customize your own test instances following the same format.
